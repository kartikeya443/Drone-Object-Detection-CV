# Drone Object Detection System

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time object detection system designed for drone applications. It utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify and classify objects in video streams, making it ideal for various drone-based surveillance and monitoring tasks.

## Key Features
- Real-time object detection using a MobileNet-based neural network
- Support for multiple object classes (based on COCO dataset)
- Visual feedback with bounding boxes and class labels
- Configurable detection thresholds for precision tuning

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV (cv2) for image processing and computer vision
- cvzone for enhanced OpenCV functionality
- TensorFlow (implied by the use of .pb and .pbtxt files) for the neural network model

## Potential Applications
- Search and rescue operations
- Wildlife monitoring
- Agricultural surveillance
- Urban planning and traffic monitoring
- Security and surveillance

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install opencv-python cvzone`
3. Download the MobileNet model files and COCO names file
4. Run `main.py` to start the object detection system

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with drone camera feeds
- GPS tagging of detected objects
- Optimization for drone-specific hardware
- Implementation of drone control based on detections

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the project are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.
